# About
Since Fivem (GTA5 modification) automatically creates an endpoint at the server address containing informations about users (discord, id, etc.) i made this to search specific users and their details on discord without having to connect to a server.
Endpoint is at ip.com/players.json

Data on API looks like this 
`[{"endpoint":"127.0.0.1","id":145,"identifiers":["steam:110000143531xxx","license:965dd915a9c89ac444e310abxxxxxxxxx","discord:61522643xxxxxxxx","fivem:557xxxxx","license2:965dd915a9c89ac444e310ab56b6axxxxxxx],"name": "somename","ping":35}`
